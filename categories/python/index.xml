      <description>What is SpeeQL? SpeeQL is an interactive screen-based self-help kiosk system, which can take speech, text or images as input and make your shopping experience at stores much better. This project uses Automatic Speech Recognition, NER, and Image Classification together with OCR to build a smart in-store touch-free shopping assistant for brick and mortar stores. It also consists of a Q&amp;amp;A system developed using transformers and a recommendation system. Was later adopted by P&amp;amp;G to deploy on scale.</description>
